                    I got started on my software developer career studing at Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid, where I graduated as a software engineer after 4
                    years.<br /><br />
                    There, I had the oportunity to learn a lot of languages and techologies, although I think the most important thing I learned are good software
                    practices, agile methodologies and software architecture and infrastructure. I also had the chance to work with a lot of other developers,
                    which forced me to learn even more from them.<br /><br />

                    That made me be the developer I am today, and be able to write efficient, sustainable and writable code.

                    After finishing my degree, I knew I wanted to expand my knowledge. I didn't really have any specific subject i wanted to specialize on, so I
                    decided to apply for the Distributed and Embedded Systems Software Master's, where I got accepted. There i got to learn a lot of different branches
                    of the software development world, which was exactly what I was looking for.<br /><br />

                    From the most advanced blockchain or machine learning technologies, to low level electronic and real time software development, I made projects
                    following the whole life cycle, as if it was a real world scenario.

                I have always been a very curious person. That translates to my profesional life and hobbies. When i see a project, game or interesting<br />
                system, I can't help but question myself how it was made and if I could make it myself.<br /><br />

                This exact same thing happens when a new techology, framework or language is developed. I love to take a look at the project, understand<br />
                the basics and think of possible use cases where that particular thing could be applied. That leads to tons of fun and interesting project<br />
                ideas to work on, and new opportunities to learn.

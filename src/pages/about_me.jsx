                    I got started on my software developer career studing at Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid, where I graduated as a software engineer after 4
                    years.<br /><br />
                    There, I had the oportunity to learn a lot of languages and techologies, although I think the most important thing I learned are good software
                    practices, agile methodologies and software architecture and infrastructure. I also had the chance to work with a lot of other developers,
                    which forced me to learn even more from them.<br /><br />

                    That made me be the developer I am today, and be able to write efficient, sustainable and writable code.

                    After finishing my degree, I knew I wanted to expand my knowledge. I didn't really have any specific subject i wanted to specialize on, so I
                    decided to apply for the Distributed and Embedded Systems Software Master's, where I got accepted. There i got to learn a lot of different branches
                    of the software development world, which was exactly what I was looking for.<br /><br />

                    From the most advanced blockchain or machine learning technologies, to low level electronic and real time software development, I made projects
                    following the whole life cycle, as if it was a real world scenario.

                  I have always been a very curious person. That translates to my profesional life and hobbies. When i see a project, game or interesting
                  system, I can't help but question myself how it was made and if I could make it myself.<br /><br />

                  This exact same thing happens when a new techology, framework or language is developed. I love to take a look at the project, understand
                  the basics and think of possible use cases where that particular thing could be applied. That leads to tons of fun and interesting project
                  ideas to work on, and new opportunities to learn.

                And that's how this project was born! This website was developed using React. I also had the opportunity to check out Vue and Angular, which are
                very similar, but each and every one of them have their unique use cases which makes it very important to chose the correct one.<br /><br />

                A good developer should invest time in thinking, structuring and choosing the right tools before writing any line of code before starting a project.
                That makes the difference between a sustainable and robust product and a failure that will fall eventually.<br/><br/>

                Starting a project is easy, ending it is not.<br/><br/>
